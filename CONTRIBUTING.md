Welcome to the Pinepods Repository! Thanks for considering contributing to this passion project! Check out the Readme if you haven't for a project overview. 

Not a whole lot of rules here. To contribute to this project please simply fork the project and create a pull request when done with detail on what you added. Take a look at the issues for some inspiration. There's quite a few issues in there listed as first time issues that, once you get a hang of the project would be super quick to fix. There's also an issue in there to fill out some documentation in the external documentation repo for some no-code contributions. 

Here's the docs repo: https://github.com/madeofpendletonwool/Pinepods-Docs
There's also Pinepods Firewood, a project I've been working on for a CLI interface to either share pocasts to or browse podcasts on your Pinepods server. Entirely built in Rust!
